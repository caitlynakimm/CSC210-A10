# A10 Huffman Coding

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. If an item doesn't apply, please write N/A.

## General Information
Programming Partner Name (if you did pair programming and would like to be graded together):
- N/A

Other Collaborators (and kudos to helpful members of the class):
- N/A

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials (including AI consultations):

- I consulted ChatGPT on suggestions for how to separate the binary code and ASCII value in each line of a code file and to check if I used recursion properly in my traverse method in the HuffEncode class.

## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?
- I think the most challenging parts of this assignment were figuring out how to separate the binary codes and ASCII values from each other, keeping in mind to convert ASCII values to their actual characters, and building a map through recursion which involved other things like reading each character from original.txt in the main method. I think the most interesting thing was learning about input redirection, especially learning/reviewing how to use BufferedReader and Scanner and printing to System.out (for encoded.txt and decoded.txt). I think I will use input redirection again, maybe when I write programs that take in files as input or maybe to create/update leaderboards for a game.
